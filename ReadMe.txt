Fruit quality detection is a crucial task in the agricultural industry, impacting the overall market value and consumer satisfaction. Traditional methods for assessing fruit quality are often labor-intensive and subjective, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for fruit quality detection that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze and classify fruit quality based on visual features extracted from high-resolution images. Our proposed system is designed to handle various types of fruits and is trained on a large dataset comprising diverse fruit samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, achieving high accuracy in identifying key quality attributes such as ripeness, freshness, and defects. Furthermore, we discuss the deployment of our model in real-world scenarios, highlighting its potential for automating fruit quality assessment in production and distribution processes. Our findings suggest that deep learning can significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of fruit quality detection, thereby benefiting both producers (FARMERS MAILNY), and consumers in the agricultural supply chain.
